**The sovereign, non-custodial quantitative platform powered by the Remora Engine.**

Built by one person over 21 months. Research methodologies, cryptographic anchors, and failure post-mortems are **public**. Proprietary execution bots and order-routing infrastructure are **private**. Zero custody. Not financial advice.

- **Main Platform**: [https://hypernatt.com](https://hypernatt.com)
- **Live Proof of Process**: [https://hypernatt.com/audit](https://hypernatt.com/audit)
- **Live Public Telemetry**: [https://hypernatt.com/v2dry/](https://hypernatt.com/v2dry/)
- **MCP Terminal (Public Repository)**: [https://github.com/hypernatt/hypernatt-terminal](https://github.com/hypernatt/hypernatt-terminal)

> **Public mirror notice:** This repository is the public verification mirror for HyperNatt. It anchors all figures, claims, and benchmark matrices displayed on the live platform to immutable SHA-256 digests.

---

## 1. Quick Start — Independent Verification (30 Seconds)

Any developer, quant, or jury member can verify that 100% of claims on [hypernatt.com/audit](https://hypernatt.com/audit) match their underlying cryptographic source notes:

```bash
# Clone the public mirror repository
git clone https://github.com/hypernatt/hypernatt.git
cd hypernatt

# Run the standalone zero-dependency verification script
node scripts/verify_ledger.mjs
```

## 2. The Core Premise: Proof of Process

Most algorithmic trading projects make unverifiable marketing claims about backtests, win rates, and proprietary algorithms. HyperNatt operates on a different standard: **Proof of Process**.

1. **Every Figure Anchored**: Every metric shown on the public audit dashboard (win rates, drawdowns, loss ceilings, sample sizes) cites a specific research note with an immutable SHA-256 hash.
2. **Documented Failures**: We publicly document discarded hypotheses, failure modes, and engineering errors (e.g. the legacy holding-time cap in Note 420).
3. **On-Chain Truth**: Real fills, margin balance, and liquidation distance are visible directly on the [Hyperliquid L1 Vault Contract](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/vaults/0x04e2eb302fe9ff23a9d1f2455084af624737a6d8).

---

## 3. The Scientific Discovery: Intrabar Oracle Bias (Era 670)

A core demonstration of HyperNatt's quantitative honesty occurred during the comprehensive audit of Era 670 (Note 670):

- **The Historical Close Illusion**: Across 5.65 years of 15m historical candles (2021–2026), filtering for candle closes with rejection/force $\ge 5.0$ displayed an apparent **83% Win Rate and +39.73 bps net EV**.
- **The Empirical Refutation**: When audited at the exact crossing threshold (entering in real time via LIMIT order), the signal produced a **strictly negative net EV (-7.73 bps on ETH)**.
- **The Root Cause**: The +39.73 bps was an in-bar selection artifact. 15-minute OHLC bars are mathematically blind to whether an in-progress sweep will be absorbed or accelerate into a liquidation cascade.
- **The Resolution**: 
  - The live vault remains **100% FLAT** (`VAULT_ENTRY_ENABLED=false`) to protect depositor capital.
  - A continuous **24/7 L2 WebSocket recorder** was deployed on GCP VPS to capture sub-second book depth and trade aggression for BTC and ETH, laying the foundation for causal microstructure research (Mission 06).

## 4. The Remora Philosophy (4 Pillars)

| Pillar | Principle | Operational Rule |
|---|---|---|
| **1. MM-Aware** | Remora clings to the shark | Read market-maker liquidation traps, sweeps, and reclaim levels before entering. Never trade generic indicator crossovers. |
| **2. Poker Edge** | Play only positive EV | Trade only with mathematical expectation net of fees and slippage. **HOLD is a first-class decision**, not an error. |
| **3. Surgeon Diagnosis** | Causal post-mortems | Dissect MAE (Maximum Adverse Excursion) and MFE on every trade to identify the structural cause of every exit. |
| **4. Mathematical Truth** | Science before code | If empirical data refutes a theory, the theory is discarded immediately. Zero narrative bias. |

### What We Do NOT Claim

| We do **not** claim | What we **do** anchor & demonstrate |
|---|---|
| Guaranteed future profit or "no-loss" algorithm | Zero depositor liquidations across 5.6+ years backtest & live flat protection |
| Intrabar predictive edge from historical 15m OHLC | Documented in-bar oracle bias; -7.73 bps threshold refutation publicly proven |
| Custody or discretionary management of user deposits | 100% non-custodial Hyperliquid L1 vault; agent wallet has zero withdrawal permissions |
| Public dump of proprietary execution bot code | Public mathematical research, cryptographic Proof of Process ledger, independent CLI verification |
| Tokens, ICOs, or presales | Pure non-custodial DeFi vault architecture on Hyperliquid L1 |

## 5. Non-Custodial Architecture

HyperNatt is built from the ground up to prevent custodial counterparty risk:

- **Hyperliquid L1 Native Vault**: [`0x04e2eb302fe9ff23a9d1f2455084af624737a6d8`](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/vaults/0x04e2eb302fe9ff23a9d1f2455084af624737a6d8).
- **Consensus Enforcement**: The automated agent wallet possesses **strictly order-routing rights**. Hyperliquid L1 consensus mathematically blocks the agent from initiating withdrawals or transferring funds.
- **Immediate Sovereign Redemptions**: Depositors retain 100% custody of their vault shares and can redeem capital directly through the L1 blockchain at any time.
